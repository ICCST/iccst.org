<h3>Privacy, Data Protection</h3>
This website does not use cookies or any other tracking technology. No data is made available to IPB Halle. However, it is technically impossible to deliver this page without the processing of personal data. The data processed usually includes: 
<ul>
<li>your IP address</li>
<li>the access time</li>
<li>the URLs of the requested resources</li>
<li>information about your browser and operating system</li>
<li>information about referring pages if accessed from external pages</li>
</ul>
The ICCST.org page is brought to you by Github Pages (<a href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>). Your personal data is therefore processed by GitHub according to their <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement">privacy policy</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>. 

<h3>Declaration on Accessibility</h3>
The target audience of this website are scientists from all over the world. It is therefore neither possible nor appropriate to present the site in plain language throughout. The website operators endeavor to make the content of the website available with the lowest possible access barriers. Nevertheless, for design reasons, some barriers result from 
<ul>
<li>elements with low contrast</li>
<li>elements with small fonts</li>
<li>images without alternative text</li>
<li>documents from external sources</li>
</ul>
In most cases, these elements have either no semantic meaning or are accessible by alternative means (e.g. through the <a href="?1">site map</a>). In addition, some elements may inadvertently be
<ul>
<li>not operable with the keyboard</li>
<li>not correctly labeled semantically</li>
<li>otherwise provided with accessibility barriers</li>
</ul>
We're constantly working to reduce barriers as much as possible. 

<h4>Feedback</h4>
If you wish to report accessibility issues, you can contact us using the contact options given above.

<h4>Enforcement procedure</h4>
If you have reported a barrier to us and we have not given you a satisfactory response from your point of view after one month, you can contact the ombudsman's office in accordance with Section 16d of the Disability Equality Act of Saxony-Anhalt (BGG LSA) (ombudsstelle@ukst.de). You can also contact the ombudsman's office using the telephone and postal contact options of the State Office for Accessibility Saxony-Anhalt:
