The logo for the 16th ICCST is available in 3 formats:
------------------------------------------------------

- iccst16_logo.png
  PNG for low resolution use and when SVG support is not available

- iccst16_logo_PT-Sans-Bold.svg
  SVG with text elements that are displayed as text: This file depends 
  on the availability of the "PT Sans Bold" font. If "PT Sans Bold" is 
  not available, it will be replaced by a font with different metrics, 
  resulting in a shift of the graphic elements. Use this file to create
  variants of the logo.

- iccst16_logo_path.svg
  SVG with text elements that are displayed as path: The font glyphs 
  have been converted to SVG paths. The file no longer depends on the 
  availability of a specific font. Preferably use this file on any 
  ICCST material.
