<h2>Wolfgang Günther Award</h2>
<p>
In memory of <a href="https://www.iccst.org/?2">Wolfgang Günther</a>, the founder of the <a href="https://youtu.be/KUogB-m6CB4" target="_blank">ICCST conference series</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>, we are awarding the Wolfgang Günther Prize, endowed with EUR 500, a silver medal (see picture), and conference participation support. The award is supported by the Gunther family and conference sponsors.
</p><p>
The award has two categories: The <i>Lifetime Achievement</i> and the <i>Scientific Excellence Award in Se/Te-Chemistry (and related sciences)</i>. All scientist active in the ICCST area can nominate candidates. The ICCST-IAB (International Advisory Board) will vote and decide for the winners, which will be honored during the conference (Fri 29. Aug. 2025).

The International Advisory Bord of ICCST is proud to bestow the first<br/>
<span class="personName">Wolfgang Günther Award for Lifetime Achievements in Selenium and Tellurium Chemistry</span><br/>
to<br/>
<span class="personName">Prof. Dr. Tristram Chivers</span><br/>
University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada
</p><p>
Professor Chivers is a worldwide recognized leader in main group chemistry, in particular the chalcogens, with pioneering and sustained contributions to selenium and tellurium chemistry that have profoundly shaped the field and inspired generations of researchers. He has authored over 415 peer-reviewed articles, 37 reviews, 31 book chapters, and 3 authoritative books. He was the first to synthesize and structurally characterize key selenium-nitrogen and tellurium-nitrogen compounds. These discoveries corrected longstanding misconceptions and provided new frameworks for understanding bonding and reactivity in heavier chalcogens. His development of single-source precursors for metal telluride thin films (e.g., Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>, CdTe, PbTe) has had a transformative impact on the fabrication of thermoelectric and semiconductor materials. These contributions are foundational to modern materials science and nanotechnology. Professor Chivers has been a cornerstone of the ICCST community, serving on the IAB from 2003 to 2019. He delivered plenary lectures at ICCST-7, 9, 11, and an invited lecture at ICCST-12.
His groundbreaking research, visionary leadership, and dedication to the advancement of selenium and tellurium chemistry make him a most deserving recipient.

The Laudatio will be given by Prof. Dr. Ignacio Vargas-Baca, followed by a scientific award talk by Prof. Chivers.

and the<br/>
<span class="personName">Wolfgang Günther Award  for Scientific Excellence in Selenium and Tellurium Chemistry</span><br/>
to<br/>
<span class="personName">Prof. Dr. Jens Beckmann</span><br/>
University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany
</p><p>
Over the past decade, Jens Beckmann has achieved outstanding results in the inorganic, organometallic and materials chemistry of group 16 elements, particularly selenium and tellurium. His work represents significant milestones in main-group element chemistry and has been published in high-impact international journals, including Angewandte Chemie, Journal of the American Chemical Society, Chemical Science, and Chemistry – A European Journal.  His wealth of research involving selenium and especially tellurium is outstanding, bringing this often undervalued field regularly into the spotlight of top research journals.

<h2>Best short talk prize</h2>
<p>
A committee of selected senior participants will select the best short talks given during the conference. The best three ones will receive a certificate. The selected best presenter will receive a price money of EUR 100 (Only if present at the ceremony, otherwise prize money goes to subsequent place! In case of equal votes, prize can be split.)
